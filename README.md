## Notes

Most challenging part of this lab was familiariazing myself with HashCat. Definitely learned a lot about it through this lab but didn't use it to it's fullest potential.

## Installation Instructions

Setup instructions can be found on the Week 6 Lab page.

It should be noted that any browser can be used; however, Chrome and Firefox have one the most user-friendly Inspect Element interfaces.
